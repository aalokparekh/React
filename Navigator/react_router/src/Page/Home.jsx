      <p>Tom Corley understands the difference between being rich and poor: at age nine, his family went from being multi-millionaires to broke in just one night.
      <br/> <br />
      For five years, Tom observed and documented the daily activities of 233 wealthy people and 128 people living in poverty. He discovered there is an immense difference between the habits of the wealthy and the poor. During his research he identified over 200 daily activities that separated the “haves” from the “have nots.” The culmination of his research can be found in his #1 bestselling book, Rich Habits – The Daily Success Habits of Wealthy Individuals.</p>
